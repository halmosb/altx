    """Implement the Adaptive Law-Based Transformation.

    Find the preserved quantities of the time series and use them to
    transform the test instances and prepare them for future
    classification and/or anomaly detection.

    Attributes
    ----------
    train_set : torch.Tensor
        The linear laws are based on this time series database.
    train_classes : torch.Tensor
        Contains the predefined class labels.

        The number of unique classes.
    class_labels : torch.Tensor
        The list of unique class labels.
    RLK : tuple
        Two-dimensional tuple for storing the used r-l-k triplets,
        where r is the length of the analyzed time window (always a
        multiple of 2*l-1), l is the dimension of the extracted laws,
        and k is the step of the time window.
    Ps : dict
        Contains the laws for r-l-k triplets, and a tensor that
        indicates which law belongs to the specific classes.

    m : int
        Number of channels. (Positive in each case.)
    device : torch.device
